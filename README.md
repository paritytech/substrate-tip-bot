# substrate-tip-bot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that can submit tips on behalf
> of a [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) based network.

# Getting started ðŸŒ±

## Usage

This bot relies on GitHub pull request that opt in via a body text comment to specify what Substrate network and address to send tips to.

### Pull request body

```sh
{kusama|polkadot|localtest} address: <SS58 Address>
```

Followed by a _comment_ on said pull request

### Pull request comment

```sh
/tip {small | medium | large}
```



## Local development ðŸ”§

To use this bot, you'll need to have an `.env` file. Most of the options will
automatically be generated by the GitHub application creation process, but you will also need to add
`ACCOUNT_SEED` and `ALLOWED_USERS`.

A reference env file is placed at `.env.example` to copy over

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

### Run polkadot or substrate `localtest` network locally

- Follow readme in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot#development to run local network. 
  - Among all dependencies, main steps are (from repo): 
    - Compile `cargo b -r`
    - Run `./target/release/polkadot --dev`
- [Create 2 accounts: for "bot" & for "contributor"](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/accounts) 
  - Save the seeds & passwords somewhere
  - Set `ACCOUNT_SEED` as bot's seed in `.env` file  
- Transfer some meaningful amount from test accounts (like Alice) to a new bot account (from which bot will be send tip to the contributor)

### Create GitHub application for testing

- Note: During app creation save according env variables to `.env` file
- Read [Getting-started](https://gitlab.parity.io/groups/parity/opstooling/-/wikis/Bots/Development/Getting-started) doc to get a sense of how to work with bots
- Follow [creating app](https://gitlab.parity.io/groups/parity/opstooling/-/wikis/Bots/Development/Create-a-new-GitHub-App)
and [installing app](https://gitlab.parity.io/groups/parity/opstooling/-/wikis/Bots/Development/Installing-the-GitHub-App)
guidance
- `WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL` you can generate via https://smee.io/new

#### Github app permissions

##### Repository permissions:
- **Issues**: Read-only
  - Allows for interacting with the comments API
- **Pull Requests**: Read & write
  - Allows for posting comments on pull requests
##### Organization permissions
- **Members**: Read-only
  - Related to $ALLOWED_ORGANIZATIONS: this permission enables the bot to request the organization membership of the command's requester even if their membership is private
##### Event subscriptions
- **Issue comment**
  - Allows for receiving events for pull request comments

### Start a bot

After registering and configuring the bot environment, we can run it. We use
[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for hot-reloading, the `probot` package
automatically parses the relevant `.env` values.

```sh
$ yarn start
```

### Create a PR and test it
You'll need 2 gh users: contributor and maintainer (since it's not allowed for contributors to send a tip to themselves)

- From contributor GH account: create a PR and add into PR description `localtest address: <contributor polkadot address>`
- From maintainer GH account: write `/tip small` in comments so the bot sends funds to <contributor polkadot address>

### Docker

To run the bot via Docker, we need to build and then run it like so

```sh
$ docker build -t substrate-tip-bot .
```

```sh
$ docker run \
    -e APP_ID=<app-id> \
    -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> \
    substrate-tip-bot
```
